Description: Music Player Daemon
 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
 playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams
 (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists.  Gapless playback, buffered
 output, and crossfading support is also included.  The design focus is
 on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control
 for music playback over a TCP/IP network.  The goals are to be easy to
 install and use, to have minimal resource requirements (it has been
 reported to run fine on a Pentium 75), and to remain stable and
 flexible.
 .
 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the
 same computer mpd runs on.  The separate client and server design
 allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes
 independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually
 plays music.
